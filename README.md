## What Is It?
This repository contains the files for my personal website.

## Why Was It Done?
I created this project to have my personal website visible on the internet. I worked with Next.js, integrating it with MaterializeCSS and GitHub Pages.

## How Was It Made?
I primarily built it using Next.js and a material design framework called MaterializeCSS. The rest is pure HTML and CSS to keep it simple and easy to maintain.
